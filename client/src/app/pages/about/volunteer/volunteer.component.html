        We're always looking for passionate individuals to help grow the cubing community in South Africa.
        Whether you have a few hours to spare or want to take on a more involved role,
        there are many ways to contribute.
      </p>

      <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>

      <h3>Volunteering at Events:</h3>
      <p> We always need help running competitions smoothly. This starts with the running, judging, and scrambling roles
        you may already have seen at competitions, but we also really appreciate help is with other tasks such as data
        capture, setting up the day before, and taking down and packing up equipment after the competition.
        If you're interested in helping with these tasks, please reach out to the competition organisers
        in the week before the competition to find out when and how you can help. </p>

      <h3>Community Outreach:</h3>
      <p> If you enjoy sharing your passion for cubing with others, perhaps you could help us with demonstrations at
        schools or community centers. While we aren't actively seeking out these opportunities, we may be able to support
        with any initiatives you start. </p>

      <h3>Website and Graphic Design:</h3>
      <p> If you have skills or interest in software development or graphic design, we have several tasks that might
        interest you. You can find these listed on our GitHub page: <a
